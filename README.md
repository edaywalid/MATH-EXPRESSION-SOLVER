SOLVING MATH EXPRESSION GETTING STRINGS ONLY
THE IDEA IS TO TRANSFROM THE EXPRESSION INTO POSFIX EXPRESSION 
AND SOLVE IT TO GET THE RESULT 

POSFIX MEANS : FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAVE 5+6*9-8
THE POSFIX OF THIS IS  : 5 6 9 * + 8 - 
THE POSFIX EXPRESSION IS WHAT THE COMPAILER USE TO SOLVE MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS\

I USED THAT SPECIFIC STRUCTURE OF NODE BECAUSE THE MEMORY TRNASFORM THE FLOAT NUMBERS INTO IEE754 EXPREESION WHICH WILL MAKE IT EASY TO SOLVE 

SINCE IM NOT MEMORY SO I USED THIS IDEA AND IT WORKED
